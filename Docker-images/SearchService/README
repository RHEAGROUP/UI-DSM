UI-DSM Search Service container application

# Build and Deploy using Docker

The UI-DSM Search Service container is built using docker and docker buildkit and the result is a Docker container ready to be deployed (or pushed to a Docker registry). The Docker file is located in the Docker-images/SearchService project folder.

> The Docker command needs to be executed from the commandline in the **solution** folder. 

For docker login, create a (ui-dsm_framework) project level access token. 

```
$ ./solutionfolder# docker login gitlab.esa.int:4567
$ ./solutionfolder# docker build -f Docker-images/SearchService/Dockerfile -t rheagroup/ui-dsm-search-service:latest -t rheagroup/ui-dsm-search-service:<version> . 
```

Run the container in local environment

```
docker run -p 2222:80 -it -d --name ui-dsm-search-service --net uidsm-net rheagroup/ui-dsm-search-service:latest
```

Push to docker registry

```
$ ./solutionfolder# docker push rheagroup/ui-dsm-search-service:latest
